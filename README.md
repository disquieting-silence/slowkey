slowkey
=======

The `slowkey` application is a basic keyboard replacement for Android devices. It is not designed for rapid text input, but rather for accurate and deliberate text input. It clearly has no real use case, but that hasn't stopped any of the other projects available here. The images on the keys were reused from the `SoftKeyboard` project which comes as one of the samples provided with the Android SDK. 


It is a constant state of change. The only constant is that it probably doesn't work on your device. Generally, the master branch is months behind development.

# SlowKey

At the moment, this is a binary keyboard alternative for Android. Obviously, that has no use. It's just an experiment at this stage before a more thorough keyboard implementation is developed.

The project is heavily in debt to the SoftKeyboard project provides in the Android samples. It uses images from there.
